This directory contains templates for cmake.

To use the templates in this directory,  where XXX is the product name:
1. cp product_deps.template <your-source-code>/ups/product_deps
2. cp setup_for_development.template <your-source-code>/ups/setup_for_development
3. The ups convention is that product names will be all lower case.
4. Edit the list of required products and qualifiers in product_deps
5. Check setup_for_development - in most cases it will not need to be modified

See example/ToyCmake for a complete example which uses cmake to build hello world
and create a relocateable ups tarball.
