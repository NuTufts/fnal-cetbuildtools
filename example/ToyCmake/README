This is a very simple example for cmake.  It will build a library, an executable,
and install files into a directory ready to be tarred up as a relocateable ups product.
Various CET conventions:
1. Include files are of the form #include "MyProduct/MyHeader.h"
2. Source code and headers live in the same directory
3. 4 flavors are supported: 32bit and 64bit SL4 and SL5
4. Use ups/setup_for_development to establish the development build environment
