This is a very simple example for cmake.
It builds two libraries and an executable.

To use this example:
mkdir <my-empty-directory>
cd <my-empty-directory>
cp -pr example/ToyCmake .
mkdir build install
cd build (this is your working directory)
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(pwd)/../install \
      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      ../example/ToyCmake
      
make
make test
make install
make package (create a distribution tarball)

See READMEs and comments in the various files for specific information
about customizing for your package.
