This is a very simple example for cmake.  It will build a library, an executable,
and install files into a directory ready to be tarred up as a relocateable ups product.

To use this example:
mkdir <my-empty-directory>
cd <my-empty-directory>
cp -pr $CETBUILDTOOLS_DIR/example/ToyCmake .
mkdir build install
cd build (this is your working directory)
source ../ToyCmake/ups/setup_for_development
   This will setup cmake and gcc v4_5_1
   This will also define TOY_CODE and TOY_WORKDIR
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install $TOY_CODE
make
make test
make install

See READMEs and comments in the various files for specific information
about customizing for your package.
